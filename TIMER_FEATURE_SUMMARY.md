# Timer Feature - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### Timer System
A complete timer tracking system has been implemented for the Memory Card Flip Game with the following features:

#### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Automatic Start**: Timer starts when gameplay begins
- **Real-time Display**: Timer shown in top-right corner during gameplay (MM:SS format)
- **Pause Support**: Timer freezes when game is paused (ESC key)
- **Resume Accuracy**: Paused time is excluded from total time
- **Final Time Display**: Completion time shown on game over screen
- **Score Integration**: Time affects final score calculation

### Key Timer Methods

```cpp
// Game.cpp - Timer Methods
float getElapsedTime() const;           // Get current elapsed time
void drawTimer();                       // Display timer on screen
void startNewGame(Difficulty);          // Initialize timer
void pauseGame();                       // Pause and freeze timer
void resumeGame();                      // Resume with correct time offset
```

```cpp
// Utils.cpp - Time Formatting
std::string formatTime(float seconds);  // Format as MM:SS
```

### Timer Logic Flow

1. **Game Start** → `m_gameStartTime = GetTime()`
2. **Each Frame** → `m_currentTime = GetTime()` (during PLAYING state)
3. **Display** → `elapsedTime = m_currentTime - m_gameStartTime`
4. **Pause** → `m_pausedTime = GetTime()` (timer frozen)
5. **Resume** → `m_gameStartTime += pauseDuration` (exclude paused time)
6. **Game Over** → Final time displayed and used for scoring

### Scoring System

The timer enables competitive gameplay through scoring:

```cpp
void ScoreManager::calculateScore(int moves, float time) {
    int baseScore = 10000;
    int movePenalty = moves * 10;
    int timePenalty = static_cast<int>(time) * 5;
    
    m_currentScore = baseScore - movePenalty - timePenalty;
}
```

**Scoring Formula**: `Score = 10,000 - (moves × 10) - (seconds × 5)`

### Visual Design

**In-Game Timer Display:**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Time: 01:23    │  ← Top-right corner
└─────────────────┘
- Semi-transparent background
- Yellow text for visibility
- MM:SS format
```

**Game Over Screen:**
```
CONGRATULATIONS!
You Won!

Time: 01:23
Total Moves: 42
Matches Found: 8
```

## How to Use

### Building the Project
```powershell
# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake ..

# Build
cmake --build .

# Run
.\bin\memory_game.exe
```

### Playing with Timer
1. Start game from main menu
2. Select difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
3. Timer starts automatically
4. Match all card pairs as quickly as possible
5. Press ESC to pause (timer freezes)
6. View final time on victory screen

## Technical Details

### Timer Variables
```cpp
float m_gameStartTime;  // When game started (GetTime())
float m_currentTime;    // Current frame time
float m_pausedTime;     // When pause began
```

### State Management
- **MAIN_MENU**: Timer not running
- **PLAYING**: Timer actively counting
- **PAUSED**: Timer frozen at pause moment
- **GAME_OVER**: Timer shows final completion time

### Pause/Resume Logic
```cpp
// When pausing
m_pausedTime = GetTime();

// When resuming
float pauseDuration = GetTime() - m_pausedTime;
m_gameStartTime += pauseDuration;  // Shift start time forward
```

This ensures paused time is NOT counted in the final elapsed time.

## Benefits

### For Players
✅ Track completion times  
✅ Compete for fastest times  
✅ Set personal records  
✅ Challenge friends  
✅ See progress in real-time  

### For Developers
✅ Score calculation based on performance  
✅ High score/leaderboard capability  
✅ Analytics and statistics  
✅ Replay value through time challenges  
✅ Foundation for time-based game modes  

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Timer starts at 00:00 when game begins
- [x] Timer increments correctly (1 second per second)
